Instructions

Build a shopping cart for your application using the provided design spec and
data using modern web standards and any libraries or frameworks you
think will help you accomplish the task. We believe this should take no more
than 3 or 4 hours, but if you would like to spend more time on it that's OK.

Please submit code as if you intended to ship it to production. The details
matter. We're looking to see that it could belong in the scope of a larger
application with state management, tests, and well written, idiomatic code.
